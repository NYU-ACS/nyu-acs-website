# September 2025: Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems

üè† **[‚Üê Back to Main](../index.md)** | üìö **[Resources](resources.md)**

## Week 1: Fundamentals and Setup
**Focus:** Building foundational understanding and practical setup

- **Introduction to Agents**: Core concepts, architectures, and types of autonomous systems
- **Setting up an Agent**: Development environment, frameworks, and basic agent implementation
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Anthropic's open standard for AI systems to integrate with external tools, data sources, and APIs
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for effective agent instruction and behavior design

## Week 2: Current Challenges and Limitations
**Focus:** Understanding real-world constraints and problems

- **Context Windows**: Managing limited context and information processing capabilities
- **Real-time Performance**: First token latency optimization and response time considerations
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**: Google's standardized protocol for autonomous AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate as peers
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordination, task delegation, and collaborative problem-solving using A2A
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Metrics and methods for assessing agent performance and capabilities

## Week 3: Advanced Topics and Future Directions
**Focus:** Exploring cutting-edge developments and autonomous capabilities

- **Memory Systems**:
  - Vector-based memory for semantic similarity and retrieval
  - Graph-based memory for structured knowledge representation
  - Hybrid approaches combining multiple memory types
- **Auto-Agents**: Autonomous AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and performing complex tasks without direct human intervention

## Week 4: Practical Implementation and Hackathon
**Focus:** Hands-on application and creative problem-solving

- **Build Your Own Agent**: Individual or team-based development using MCP and A2A protocols
- **Team Collaboration**: Working in groups of 1-2 participants to create collaborative agent systems
- **Innovation Focus**: Encouraging creative integration of MCP tool access and A2A agent communication
