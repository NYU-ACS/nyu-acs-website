# Resources: Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems

üè† **[‚Üê Back to Main](../index.md)** | üìã **[View Plan](plan.md)**

## Week 1 Resources

### Core Technical Papers/Documentation

- **[ArXiv: "From LLM Reasoning to Autonomous AI Agents" (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19678)**  
  *Covers the evolution from basic language models to full autonomous agents. Good overview of current challenges and where the field is heading.*

- **[Model Context Protocol Official Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)**  
  *The actual spec document for MCP. A bit dry but essential if you want to understand how agents connect to external tools and data sources.*

- **[Anthropic: "Building Effective AI Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)**  
  *Practical guide from the folks who made Claude. Focuses on real-world considerations like safety, reliability, and what actually works in production.*

- **[LangGraph Multi-Agent Systems Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/)**  
  *Technical docs for building multi-agent systems. Includes code examples and patterns for getting multiple agents to work together without chaos.*

### Top Technical Blog Writers to Follow

- **[Simon Willison](https://simonw.substack.com)** - LLMs, MCP, AI agents implementation  
  *Writes about the practical side of AI tools. Great at explaining complex stuff in plain English and often shares working code examples.*

- **[Cameron R. Wolfe](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com)** - AI research deep-dives, agent architectures  
  *Deep technical breakdowns of AI research papers. Perfect when you want to understand the "why" behind agent architectures without reading 50-page papers.*

- **[Sebastian Raschka](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com)** - LLM research, technical implementations  
  *Focuses on the nuts and bolts of how LLMs actually work. Good for understanding the foundation that agents are built on.*
