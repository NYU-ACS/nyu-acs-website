üè† **[‚Üê Back to Main](../index.md)** | üìã **[View Plan](plan.md)**

## Week 1 Resources - Simple List

### Core Technical Papers/Documentation

**ArXiv: "From LLM Reasoning to Autonomous AI Agents" (2025)**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19678  
*Covers the evolution from basic language models to full autonomous agents. Good overview of current challenges and where the field is heading.*

**Model Context Protocol Official Specification**  
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18  
*The actual spec document for MCP. A bit dry but essential if you want to understand how agents connect to external tools and data sources.*

**Anthropic: "Building Effective AI Agents"**  
https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents  
*Practical guide from the folks who made Claude. Focuses on real-world considerations like safety, reliability, and what actually works in production.*

**LangGraph Multi-Agent Systems Documentation**  
https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/  
*Technical docs for building multi-agent systems. Includes code examples and patterns for getting multiple agents to work together without chaos.*

### Top Technical Blog Writers to Follow

**Simon Willison** - LLMs, MCP, AI agents implementation  
https://simonw.substack.com  
*Writes about the practical side of AI tools. Great at explaining complex stuff in plain English and often shares working code examples.*

**Cameron R. Wolfe** - AI research deep-dives, agent architectures  
https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com  
*Deep technical breakdowns of AI research papers. Perfect when you want to understand the "why" behind agent architectures without reading 50-page papers.*

**Sebastian Raschka** - LLM research, technical implementations  
https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com  
*Focuses on the nuts and bolts of how LLMs actually work. Good for understanding the foundation that agents are built on.*
