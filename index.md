# About Our Reading Group

We are a group of NYU students and researchers focused on exploring advanced computer science topics through collaborative reading and discussion. Our goal is to deepen our understanding of cutting-edge algorithms, systems, and theoretical foundations in computer science.

## What We Do

- Read and discuss seminal papers in computer science
- Explore advanced algorithms and data structures  
- Analyze system design and architecture patterns
- Share insights and practical applications
- Build hands-on projects to apply theoretical concepts

## Current Topic

### September 2025: Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
**Status:** Work in Progress

ðŸ“‹ **[View Detailed Plan](september_2025/plan.md)** | ðŸ“š **[Resources](september_2025/resources.md)**

This month we're exploring the rapidly evolving field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. We'll cover:

- **Fundamentals**: Introduction to agent architectures, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration, and prompt engineering
- **Current Challenges**: Context limitations, latency optimization, Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols, and evaluation frameworks
- **Advanced Topics**: Memory systems (vector, graph, hybrid), autonomous self-learning capabilities, and Auto-Agent development
- **Practical Application**: Building and deploying custom agents using MCP and A2A protocols in collaborative environments

**Key Technologies Covered:**
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Anthropic's open standard for standardizing how AI systems integrate with external tools, data sources, and APIs
- **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)**: Google's protocol enabling autonomous AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other as peers
- **Auto-Agents**: Autonomous AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and performing complex tasks without direct human intervention

Our focus combines theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation, allowing participants to both understand the underlying principles and gain practical experience with cutting-edge agent technologies and protocols.
